NotSwing is a lightweight widget toolkit with very simple, intuitive components.

This was a LinkedIn Hackday project (see http://hackday2011.linkedin.com/), so
the code is not very clean. NotSwing also lacks some important functionality
that you would expect from a widget toolkit, like editable textboxes. It does
have a neat demo, though!
